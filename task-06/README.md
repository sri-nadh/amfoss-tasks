This task was a bit complicated because the installation process of go package was quiet difficult for me. <br>
So i followed the steps given in the link below <br>
https://golang.org/doc/install <br>
At first i followed two authentication for two packages but it was confusing , so finally i decided to stick with the first package.<br>
Then I decided to look into files in github for knowing how certain functions were build.<br>
This file helped a lot https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit/blob/master/reddit/subreddit.go.
So i was able to extract first search results.
