Debugging Derbies was an easy task.There were syntax errors and some other errors too. Also there was a change in name of a label(Questionlabel).Since i was new to the java language ,i had some trouble understanding but  the combiler showed all the errors in order so it was quiet easy to solve them. So thankyou for this task.
